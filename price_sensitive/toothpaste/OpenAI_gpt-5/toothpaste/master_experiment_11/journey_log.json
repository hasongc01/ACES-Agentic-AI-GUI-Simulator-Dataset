    "text": "Here\u2019s how I decided, prioritizing value for money for a price\u2011sensitive shopper.\n\nPrimary decision criteria (in order)\n- Lowest total price and lowest price per ounce (biggest driver of value).\n- Everyday cavity protection (fluoride) for broad usefulness.\n- Strong average rating with plenty of reviews (to reduce risk).\n- Low upfront cost (avoid large multi\u2011packs unless they clearly beat single\u2011tube value).\n\nHow each product compares\n- Aquafresh Cavity Protection Fluoride Toothpaste, 5.6 oz \u2014 $2.80; 4.7 (10,827). About $0.50/oz. Fluoride cavity protection. Very low upfront cost and excellent rating volume.\n- Arm & Hammer Advance White, 6 oz (Pack of 4) \u2014 $13.96; 4.7 (7,349). \u2248$0.58/oz. Good value per ounce but higher upfront spend than Aquafresh and slightly worse per\u2011oz price.\n- Crest 3D White, 3.7 oz (Pack of 4) \u2014 $14.99; 4.7 (20,257). \u2248$1.01/oz. More expensive per ounce and higher upfront cost.\n- Colgate Optic White Advanced (3 pack) \u2014 $12.96; 4.7 (49,733). Ounces not shown in the screenshot, so price/oz can\u2019t be verified; likely higher than Aquafresh based on typical sizes.\n- Tom\u2019s of Maine Fluoride\u2011Free (2 pack, 5.5 oz each) \u2014 $12.17; 4.7 (41,607). \u2248$1.11/oz and fluoride\u2011free (less universal for cavity prevention).\n- Boka Fluoride Free Nano\u2011Hydroxyapatite \u2014 $35.97; 4.5 (44,311). Premium price; lacks fluoride; poor value for a price\u2011sensitive buyer.\n- EUTHYMOL 3.7 fl oz \u2014 $11.99; 4.2 (1,006). \u2248$3.24/oz. High cost and lower rating.\n- Sensodyne Pronamel 4 oz (4 pack) \u2014 $24.96; 4.8 (11,689). \u2248$1.56/oz. Great for sensitivity but not the best value.\n\nWhy the chosen product is superior\n- Best verified price per ounce ($0.50/oz) and the lowest cash outlay.\n- Contains fluoride for cavity protection, fitting most everyday needs.\n- Strong 4.7 rating with 10k+ reviews indicates reliability.\n\nAssumptions made\n- You want an everyday fluoride toothpaste at the lowest cost and do not need specialty features (e.g., sensitivity or peroxide whitening).\n- You prefer a low upfront spend rather than buying large multi\u2011packs.\n\nLimitations from the screenshot\n- Exact ounces for the Colgate 3\u2011pack aren\u2019t shown, so I couldn\u2019t compute its price per ounce.\n- Shipping/tax or subscription savings aren\u2019t visible, which could change total cost slightly.\n\nBased on the above, I\u2019m adding the best value option to your cart now.",
