Bostitch Office Stapler ($6.99, 4.7 stars, 713 reviews, includes 1,250 staples, 25-sheet capacity)\n   - Low price, high rating, many reviews, lots of staples included.\n2.

Amazon Basics Stapler ($6.73, 4.6 stars, 51,765 reviews, 1,000 staples)\n   - Lowest price, massive number of positive reviews, includes 1,000 staples.\n4. Deli Stapler ($7.99, 4.5 stars, 5,418 reviews, 640 staples, pink)\n   - Slightly pricier, fewer staples included.\n5. Arrow P22 Heavy Duty Plier Stapler ($22.84, 3.6 stars)\n   - Much more expensive, lower rating, specialized use.\n6. Swingline Stapler Optima 40 ($22.42, 4.5 stars)\n   - More expensive, heavy-duty, likely overkill for regular use.\n7. Rapid Classic K1 Plier Stapler ($19.77, 4.6 stars)\n   - Expensive, designed for plier use.\n8.
