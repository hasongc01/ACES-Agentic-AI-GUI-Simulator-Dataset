Cheapest option with massive review volume (strong reliability signal) and includes 1000 staples.\n- Bostitch Office Stapler, No\u2011Jam, includes 1,250 staples, 25\u2011sheet: $6.99, 4.7 from 713. Slightly higher rating and 250 more staples, but costs $0.26 more and has far fewer reviews.\n- M&G Desktop Stapler set with remover, 25\u2011sheet: $6.99, 4.5 from 318. Adds a remover, but lower review count and higher price than the Amazon Basics.\n- Deli Desktop Stapler (pink), 25\u2011sheet with 640 staples: $7.99, 4.5 from 5,418. Higher price and fewer included staples.\n- Marspark 10\u2011pack with 6000 staples: $39.99, 4.4 from 111. Good per\u2011unit price but high upfront cost and you likely need only one.\n- Swingline Optima 40 (40\u2011sheet), Rapid K1 Plier, Arrow P22 Plier: $19.77\u2013$22.84. Specialty/heavy\u2011duty or plier designs; overkill and poor value for a price\u2011sensitive, everyday desk stapler.\n\nWhy I\u2019m choosing the Amazon Basics:\n- It\u2019s the lowest price on the page.\n- Excellent reliability indicator: far more reviews than any other option while maintaining a high 4.6 rating.\n- Includes 1000 staples, enough to start; the extra 250 staples with Bostitch don\u2019t outweigh its higher price and much smaller review base.\n- 25\u2011sheet capacity matches typical needs; no need to pay for 40\u2011sheet/heavy\u2011duty models.\n\nAssumptions and limitations:\n- Assuming you need a standard desktop stapler for everyday use and prefer the lowest total price with solid reliability.\n- The screenshot doesn\u2019t show build materials, warranty, or staple size/spec (likely standard 26/6). If you need heavy\u2011duty stapling, long\u2011reach, or color\u2011specific, let me know and I can adjust.\n\nI\u2019ll add the Amazon Basics stapler to the cart now for best value.",
