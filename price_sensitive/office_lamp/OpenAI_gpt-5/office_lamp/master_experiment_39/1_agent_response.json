  "text": "Decision summary and rationale\n\nPrimary decision criteria (in order):\n- Value for money (lowest price that still provides solid functionality and reliability)\n- Office suitability (task lighting, desk/space efficiency, adjustability)\n- Proven reliability (rating plus volume of reviews)\n- Useful features (clamp, swing arm, dimming/CT if available)\n\nHow each product stacks up:\n- TORCHSTAR Metal Desk Lamp with Clamp... \u2014 $18.99, 4.3 (8,430). Only dedicated desk/task lamp here. Clamp saves desk space; swing arm/gooseneck offers precise positioning for work. Lowest price and very high review count.\n- ROTTOGOON Floor Lamp with 3 Color Temperatures... \u2014 $29.99, 4.5 (11,241). Strong value for a floor lamp with 3 CCTs, but it\u2019s a space-taking floor lamp vs desk-focused task light.\n- luckystyle LED Floor Lamp... \u2014 $29.99, 4.4 (919). Good features (remote, CCT), but floor style and higher price than TORCHSTAR.\n- GLOBE Electric 67135 Torchiere + reading light \u2014 $32.89, 4.4 (3,682). Versatile but pricier; still a floor unit.\n- Modern Floor Lamp Simple Design... \u2014 $39.99, 4.5 (6,892). Solid, but more expensive and less task-focused.\n- SUNMORY 32W/3000LM Floor Lamp... \u2014 $39.99, 4.8 (1,184). Bright and well-rated; price higher and floor style.\n- Lightdot 60IN Gold Floor Lamp... \u2014 $59.99, 4.6 (number of reviews partially obscured). Attractive but the most expensive; decorative focus.\n- Fqieqs 3 Globe Mid Century Floor Lamp... \u2014 $51.99, 4.4 (1,207). Decorative, not task-focused; higher price.\n\nWhy I\u2019m choosing the TORCHSTAR desk lamp:\n- Best value: It\u2019s the lowest price by a wide margin yet still has a very large review base, indicating proven reliability.\n- Office/task fit: Clamp + adjustable swing arm/gooseneck are ideal for concentrated desk work and save space\u2014better suited than floor lamps for an office setup.\n- Sufficient quality signals: 4.3/5 with 8,430 reviews is strong enough to trust for everyday office use at this price.\n\nAssumptions I made:\n- You want a lamp primarily for desk-based office tasks (reading, typing, video calls) rather than ambient room lighting.\n- You\u2019re willing to trade premium extras (remote, stepless color tuning) for a lower price and core adjustability.\n- You have a desk edge suitable for a clamp mount.\n\nLimitations from the listing:\n- Lumens output, bulb type/inclusion, and color temperature range for the TORCHSTAR are not specified in the screenshot. This uncertainty slightly increases risk, but given the price, adjustability, and review volume, it still offers the best value. If you need a guaranteed included bulb and tunable color temps, the ROTTOGOON floor lamp at $29.99 would be my runner-up.\n\nI\u2019ll add the TORCHSTAR desk lamp to your cart now for the best price-to-function ratio.",
