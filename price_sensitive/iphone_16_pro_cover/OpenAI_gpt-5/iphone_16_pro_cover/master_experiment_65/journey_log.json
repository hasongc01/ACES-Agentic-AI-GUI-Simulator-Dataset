Lowest price with solid rating and sizable reviews. Labeled Sponsored, but the review volume helps validate it.\n  - Mkeke Clear\u2026 \u2014 $9.99, 4.6 (128228), clear, strong trust; no explicit MagSafe mentioned (possible drawback if you use MagSafe accessories).\n  - ESR for iPhone 16 Pro\u2026 \u2014 $12.99, 4.6 (109440), MagSafe and \u201cCamera Control\u201d; excellent trust but higher price than top value picks.\n  - LOVE 3000 Silicone\u2026 \u2014 $9.99, 4.6 (10231), silicone; MagSafe not stated.\n  - Miracase Magnetic\u2026 \u2014 $16.95, 4.3 (108070), full\u2011body with built\u2011in glass protector; more expensive and slightly lower rating.\n  - DEERLAMN Case\u2026 \u2014 $14.99, 4.4 (2030), includes 2 screen protectors and ring stand; decent value but pricier and fewer reviews.\n  - Magnetic Case (women/clear design)\u2026 \u2014 $9.99, 4.7 (14); too few reviews to judge value.\n  - OtterBox Commuter\u2026 \u2014 $49.99, 4.4 (472); great brand but not value\u2011oriented at this price.\n- Why I\u2019m choosing SUPFINE:\n  - It\u2019s the cheapest option while still offering MagSafe and \u201cmilitary grade\u201d drop protection, with a good 4.5 rating and 15k+ reviews\u2014strong value for money.\n  - Trade\u2011offs: not a clear case and no explicit screen protector included.
