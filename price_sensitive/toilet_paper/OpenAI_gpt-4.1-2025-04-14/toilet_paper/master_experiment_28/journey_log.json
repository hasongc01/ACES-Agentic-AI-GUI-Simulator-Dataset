Here\u2019s my reasoning:\n\nPrimary Decision Criteria:\n- Value for money (low price per roll or sheet).\n- Sufficient quality, as reflected in user ratings and number of reviews.\n\nOptions Review:\n1. **Scott Professional 100% Recycled Fiber Standard Roll**: $59.99 for 80 rolls \u2248 $0.75/roll. 4.6 stars (36,399 reviews).\n2. **Angel Soft Toilet Paper**: $12.49 for 16 mega rolls (equivalent to 64 regular rolls) \u2248 $0.20/regular roll. 4.7 stars (68,132 reviews).\n3. **Scott ComfortPlus Toilet Paper**: $5.68 for 12 double rolls (24 regular rolls) \u2248 $0.24/regular roll. 4.5 stars (84,087 reviews).\n4. **Charmin Ultra Soft Cushiony Touch**: $35.49 for 123 family mega rolls.
