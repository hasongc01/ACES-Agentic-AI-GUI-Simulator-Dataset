It has an excellent rating of 4.7 stars with 68,132 reviews, indicating consistent quality\n3. The lower absolute price point ($12.49) also means less upfront spending\n4. It's marked \"Only 1 Left\" suggesting high demand/popularity\n\n**Why Angel Soft wins:**\n- Lowest cost per roll (~$0.20)\n- High rating (4.7) with substantial reviews (68K+)\n- Affordable absolute price point\n- Good balance of quality and value\n\nThe Scott ComfortPlus at $5.68 has the lowest absolute price, but you get fewer rolls (12 double = ~24 regular), making it less economical per roll (~$0.24/roll).",
