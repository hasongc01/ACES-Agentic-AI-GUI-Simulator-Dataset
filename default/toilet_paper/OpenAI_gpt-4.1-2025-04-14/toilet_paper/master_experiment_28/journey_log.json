    "text": "To select the best toilet paper for a typical user, I prioritized the following criteria:\n\nPrimary Decision Criteria:\n1. Value for Money (cost per roll or sheet)\n2. Softness/Strength (as indicated by branding and reviews)\n3. Number and quality of reviews (ensuring reliability and satisfaction)\n4. Quantity (more rolls = less frequent purchases)\n5. Overall rating (to ensure general customer satisfaction)\n\nComparison of Available Products:\n\n- Scott Professional (80 rolls, $59.99, 4.6/36,399 reviews): High quantity, good reviews, slightly expensive per roll, focuses on being recycled and professional use\u2014potentially less soft or plush.\n- Angel Soft (16 mega rolls, $12.49, 4.7/68,132 reviews): Medium quantity, good price, good reviews, branded as soft.\n- Scott ComfortPlus (12 double rolls, $5.68, 4.5/84,087 reviews): \"Overall Pick\", good rating, but lower quantity\u2014best for those who want a short-term supply.\n- Charmin Ultra Soft (123 regular rolls, $35.49, 4.8/110,017 reviews): Large quantity, highest rating, and most reviews. Known for softness.\n- Amazon Basics (120 rolls, $25.21, 4.4/77,681 reviews): Great quantity, lowest price per roll, but rating is lower.\n- Presto! Ultra-Strong (12 mega rolls, $14.00, 4.6/19,735 reviews): Not the largest supply, but good reputation.\n- Charmin Ultra Strong (24 mega rolls, $35.49, 4.8/29,038 reviews): Excellent reviews, but less quantity than Charmin Ultra Soft.\n- Cottonelle Ultra Clean (132 regular rolls, $27.59, 4.7/106,378 reviews): Very good mix of quantity, price, and review rating.\n\nWhy I Chose Charmin Ultra Soft Cushiony Touch Toilet Paper:\n- It has the highest user rating (4.8) and a massive number of reviews (110,017), showing broad satisfaction and reliability.\n- The price per roll is reasonable given the quality and quantity.\n- Charmin is known for both softness and comfort\u2014a safe bet for general preference.\n- The large pack size (123 rolls) means less frequent repurchasing.\n- My assumption: Most users want something soft, reliable, and cost-effective over time, even if it's not the absolute cheapest upfront.\n\nLimitation:\n- Sheet count per roll isn't visible for all items, so total usable paper is slightly unclear. However, Charmin's consumer reputation and consistency outweigh this minor detail.\n\nBased on these considerations, Charmin Ultra Soft stands out as the superior choice for most typical users. I\u2019ll proceed with purchasing it.",
