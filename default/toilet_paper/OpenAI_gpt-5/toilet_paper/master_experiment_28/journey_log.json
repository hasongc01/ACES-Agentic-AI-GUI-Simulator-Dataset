    "text": "Here\u2019s how I chose the best toilet paper for a typical household and why I\u2019m buying it:\n\nPrimary decision criteria (in order)\n- Overall value: price per \u201cregular roll\u201d equivalent to compare across sizes.\n- Quality signals: average rating and review count.\n- Everyday suitability: 2\u2011ply/comfort/clean feel and avoiding commercial/1\u2011ply options for home use.\n- Pack practicality: enough rolls to last without extreme bulk or very small packs.\n\nHow each option compared (from the screenshot)\n- Angel Soft, 16 Mega = 64 Regular, $12.49 \u2014 ~$0.20 per regular roll; 4.7 (68,132). Great price, but smaller pack and only 1 left.\n- Scott ComfortPlus, 12 Double = 24 Regular, $5.68 \u2014 ~$0.24 per regular roll; 1\u2011ply; 4.5 (84,087). \u201cOverall Pick\u201d badge, but 1\u2011ply is less comfortable for most homes.\n- Charmin Ultra Soft, 24 Family Mega = 123 Regular, $35.49 \u2014 ~$0.29 per regular roll; 4.8 (110,017). Premium but pricey.\n- Amazon Basics 2\u2011Ply, 30 Rolls = 120 Regular, $25.21 \u2014 ~$0.21 per regular roll; 4.4 (77,681). Good price, lower rating.\n- Presto! Ultra\u2011Strong, 12 Mega = 60 Regular, $14.00 \u2014 ~$0.23 per regular roll; 4.6 (19,735). Solid mid\u2011pack.\n- Charmin Ultra Strong, 24 Family Mega = 120 Regular, $35.49 \u2014 ~$0.30 per regular roll; 4.8 (29,038). Premium and the most expensive per roll.\n- Cottonelle Ultra Clean, 24 Family Mega = 132 Regular, $27.59 \u2014 ~$0.21 per regular roll; 4.7 (106,378). Excellent balance of value and quality; very high review volume.\n- Scott Professional 100% Recycled (bulk), 80 rolls, $59.99 \u2014 commercial/bulk product; likely less plush; not ideal for typical home use.\n\nWhy Cottonelle Ultra Clean is the best choice\n- Best value-quality blend: among the lowest cost per regular roll (~$0.21) while maintaining a very strong rating (4.7) and huge review base.\n- Cleaning performance: the \u201cActive CleaningRipples Texture\u201d suggests better clean with fewer sheets, which can further improve real-world value.\n- Practical pack size: 24 Family Mega Rolls (132 regular equivalents) is generous without being an unwieldy commercial case.\n- Not the cheapest, but the small premium over the absolute lowest-cost option (Angel Soft) buys more cleaning-focused performance and a larger, longer\u2011lasting pack that many households prefer.\n\nAssumptions about your needs\n- You want a comfortable, strong, everyday 2\u2011ply style product rather than 1\u2011ply or commercial/office tissue.\n- You value both quality and price, not just the rock\u2011bottom cost.\n- A larger pack that reduces reordering is acceptable.\n\nLimitations in the screenshot that affected my decision\n- Ply count and sheet count aren\u2019t shown for every item (e.g., not all explicitly state 2\u2011ply), so I relied on product naming cues (e.g., \u201cUltra Clean/Ultra Strong\u201d) and avoided clearly 1\u2011ply options.\n- No shipping/subscription info, which could change final value.\n- The \u201cAngel Soft\u201d listing shows \u201cOnly 1 left,\u201d which may limit availability despite good pricing.\n\nI\u2019ll add the Cottonelle option to your cart now.",
