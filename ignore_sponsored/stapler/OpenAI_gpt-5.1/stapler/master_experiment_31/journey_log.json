Choosing the best option\n\nI\u2019m assuming:\n- You don\u2019t require a specific color.\n- You don\u2019t need 10 staplers.\n- You want something proven and reliable, not specialized plier tools.\n\nGiven that, the **top contenders** are:\n- **Bostitch Office Stapler**\n- **Deli Pink Desktop Stapler**\n- **M&G Desktop Stapler Set**\n\n**Bostitch vs. Deli vs. M&G:**\n\n- **Reliability / satisfaction**\n  - Bostitch: **4.7 (713)** \u2013 best rating among the three.\n  - Deli: **4.5 (5,418)** \u2013 huge sample size, slightly lower score.\n  - M&G: **4.5 (318)** \u2013 solid but fewer data points.\n- **Price**\n  - Bostitch: **$6.99**\n  - M&G: **$6.99**\n  - Deli: **$7.99** (more expensive)\n- **Included extras**\n  - Bostitch: **1,250 staples**, \u201cNo\u2011Jam\u201d premium design.\n  - M&G: **1,000 staples + remover + two binding modes** \u2013 very handy if you remove staples often.\n  - Deli: **640 staples**, color pink.\n- **Assumptions about needs**\n  - Most users care more about reliable stapling and lots of staples than color.\n  - A built\u2011in jam\u2011resistant design is very valuable for day\u2011to\u2011day use.\n\n**Why Bostitch is superior for a general user**\n\n- **Highest rating among desktop options** (4.7) indicates fewer problems and better user satisfaction.\n- **Jam\u2011resistant design** directly addresses one of the biggest pain points with staplers.\n- **Most staples included (1,250)** at the same low price as M&G \u2013 better consumable value.\n- **Not specialized or niche** \u2013 straightforward, black, full\u2011strip office standard that will work in typical settings.\n\nThe M&G set is compelling due to the remover and binding modes, but I\u2019m prioritizing:\n1. **Long\u2011term reliability and smooth performance** (Bostitch\u2019s no\u2011jam reputation and higher rating)\n2. **Staple quantity** (more staples included means less immediate reordering)\n\nSince your preferences beyond \u201ca good stapler\u201d aren\u2019t specified, I lean toward the **most reliable, general\u2011purpose choice** rather than extra accessories.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Limitations from the screenshot\n\n- I can\u2019t see fine print like warranty terms, material thickness (all\u2011metal vs. plastic), or detailed ergonomics.\n- I can\u2019t inspect user reviews to know about specific failure modes (e.g., misfires with thick paper).\n- I\u2019m assuming all listed 25\u2011sheet staplers can handle typical copy paper and use standard staples.\n\nThese limitations mean I rely heavily on:\n- Displayed **rating + review counts**\n- Obvious headline features (no\u2011jam, number of staples, capacity)\n- Price\n\nWithin that constraint, Bostitch still comes out ahead on core performance indicators.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Final choice\n\nI\u2019ll purchase:\n\n**\u201cBostitch Office Stapler, No-Jam Premium for Desktop, Includes 1,250 Staples, Full-Strip, 25 Sheet Capacity, Black\u201d**  \n- Price: **$6.99**  \n- Rating: **4.7**  \n- Reviews: **713**\n\nNow I\u2019ll add it to your cart.",
