    "text": "To select the best stapler among the organic search results, I considered several decision criteria:\n\n1. Value for Money: I looked for a combination of affordable price, included staples, and capacity.\n2. User Ratings & Number of Reviews: High ratings with a large number of reviews indicate customer satisfaction and reliability.\n3. Functionality & Versatility: Desktop staplers with average capacity suit most general office and home needs.\n4. Avoided Sponsored Products: As instructed, I did not consider the Amazon Basics and Swingline staplers, as these are marked \"Sponsored.\"\n\nLet\u2019s compare the main contenders:\n\n1. Bostitch Office Stapler, No-Jam Premium (Price: $6.99, Rating: 4.7/713 reviews, 1,250 staples included, 25-sheet capacity)\n   - Strong rating and review count, excellent included staple count, great value.\n2. Marspark 10 Pcs Stapler Set (Price: $39.99, Rating: 4.4/111 reviews, 6000 staples, 25-sheet capacity)\n   - Good for bulk purchase, but much more expensive (likely too much for most personal/office needs).\n3. Deli Stapler, Pink (Price: $7.99, Rating: 4.5/5418 reviews, 640 staples, 25-sheet capacity)\n   - Good rating, many reviews, slightly pricier and fewer staples than Bostitch.\n4. Arrow P22 Handheld Plier ($22.84, 3.6/1293, specialty usage, low rating)\n   - Not ideal for standard home/office use.\n5. M&G Desktop Stapler Set ($6.99, 4.5/318, 25-sheet capacity, 1000 staples with remover)\n   - Good price, solid rating, decent staple amount, includes a remover but fewer reviews overall.\n\nWhy I Chose the Bostitch Office Stapler:\n- It offers the best balance of price ($6.99), very high rating (4.7), a good number of reviews (713), and comes with an excellent amount of staples (1,250).\n- It\u2019s suitable for most common desktop needs (25-sheet capacity).\n- The \u201cOverall Pick\u201d label supports that it\u2019s a trusted, reliable choice.\n- I assumed the user wants an affordable, reliable, long-lasting stapler for typical desk use.\n- Competing products are either much more expensive, more specialized, or lack the volume/ratings for reliability.\n\nLimitations/Missing Info:\n- Color preferences, advanced features, or style are not specified, so I went for the best all-purpose value.\n- The screenshot does not specify warranty support, but high ratings typically imply good durability.\n\nI will add the Bostitch Office Stapler, No-Jam Premium for Desktop to the cart.",
