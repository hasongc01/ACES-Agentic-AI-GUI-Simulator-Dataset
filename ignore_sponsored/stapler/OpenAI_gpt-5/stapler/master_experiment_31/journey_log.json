    "text": "Here\u2019s how I chose the stapler, following your request to ignore sponsored items and pick from the organic results only.\n\nPrimary decision criteria (and why)\n- Reliability and performance: Fewer jams and a solid 25\u2011sheet capacity are key for everyday office use.\n- Value for money: Low price plus included staples reduces total cost.\n- Proven user satisfaction: High star rating with a meaningful number of reviews.\n- Practical features: Full\u2011strip desktop design, standard staples, non-specialized use.\n\nHow each organic product performed\n- Bostitch Office Stapler, No-Jam Premium\u2026 Black \u2014 $6.99, 4.7 (713). No\u2011jam claim, 25\u2011sheet, full\u2011strip, includes 1,250 staples. Best combination of price, rating, and included supplies.\n- Marspark 10 Pcs Stapler\u2026 Bulk \u2014 $39.99, 4.4 (111). Good if you need 10 staplers, but poor value if you only want one.\n- Deli Stapler\u2026 Pink \u2014 $7.99, 4.5 (5418). Strong popularity, includes 640 staples, but slightly lower rating, higher price, and color may not suit everyone.\n- Arrow P22 Heavy Duty Handheld Plier \u2014 $22.84, 3.6 (1293). Specialized plier style with lower rating and higher price; not ideal for typical desktop use.\n- Rapid Classic K1 Plier Stapler \u2014 $19.77, 4.6 (2008). Better plier option, but still costlier and specialized versus a standard desk stapler.\n- M&G Desktop Stapler with 25 Sheet Capacity\u2026 \u2014 $6.99, 4.5 (318). Good value, includes 1000 staples and a remover, but fewer reviews and slightly lower rating than Bostitch.\n\nWhy the Bostitch is superior for most users\n- Best value: Tied for lowest price yet includes the most staples (1,250), reducing immediate refill needs.\n- Strongest reliability signal: Highest star rating among the comparable desk staplers with a solid review count.\n- Right feature set: No\u2011jam design, 25\u2011sheet capacity, full\u2011strip desktop format\u2014ideal for everyday office/school use.\n- Neutral look (black) fits most environments.\n\nAssumptions I made\n- You want a single, standard desktop stapler rather than a bulk pack or a plier\u2011style tool.\n- Reliability and cost-effectiveness matter more than color or extra accessories.\n- 25\u2011sheet capacity is sufficient for typical tasks.\n\nLimitations from the screenshot\n- No detailed build materials, warranty info, or throat depth are shown; I prioritized rating volume, features listed, and price. I excluded the Amazon Basics and Swingline options because they are labeled \u201cSponsored,\u201d per your instruction.\n\nI\u2019ll add the Bostitch option to your cart now.",
