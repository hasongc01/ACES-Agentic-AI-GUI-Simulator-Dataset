    "text": "To select the best toilet paper among the organic results (while ignoring sponsored products), I used the following criteria as my primary decision factors:\n\n1. Value for Money (Roll Count vs. Price): Getting more rolls for a reasonable price is important, assuming the user wants a balance of quantity and cost.\n2. User Ratings and Number of Reviews: High ratings and a large number of reviews indicate product satisfaction and reliability.\n3. Ply/Softness/Strength: Higher ply counts and mentions of strength or softness suggest greater comfort and durability.\n4. Popularity/Reputation: Recognizable brands with many reviews are less risky.\n\nI evaluated the following organic search results:\n\n1. Angel Soft Toilet Paper, 16 Mega Rolls = 64 Regular Rolls, $12.49, 4.7 stars (68,132 reviews)\n   - Good value, high rating and reviews, emphasizes softness and strength.\n2. Scott ComfortPlus Toilet Paper, 12 Double Rolls = 24 Regular Rolls, $5.68, 4.5 stars (84,087 reviews)\n   - Lower price, but fewer rolls; good rating.\n3. Charmin Ultra Soft Cushiony Touch Toilet Paper, 24 Family Mega Rolls = 123 Regular Rolls, $35.49, 4.8 stars (111,017 reviews)\n   - Higher price, but large package, extremely high ratings and reviews.\n4. Amazon Basics 2-Ply Toilet Paper, 30 Rolls = 120 Regular Rolls, $25.21, 4.4 stars (77,681 reviews)\n   - Good per-roll value, but lower star rating.\n5. Presto! 2-Ply Ultra-Strong Toilet Paper, 12 Mega Rolls = 60 Regular Rolls, $14.00, 4.6 stars (19,735 reviews)\n   - Decent value, solid rating but fewer reviews.\n\nWhy I selected Angel Soft Toilet Paper, 16 Mega Rolls (my pick):\n- Value: At $12.49 for the equivalent of 64 regular rolls, it provides a very good price per roll for a major brand.\n- Reviews/Ratings: High rating (4.7) and a substantial number of reviews indicate customer satisfaction.\n- Attributes: Emphasizes both softness and strength, which should cover most user needs.\n- Assumptions: I'm assuming the user wants a solid balance between comfort, value, and customer satisfaction for regular household use.\n\nLimitations:\n- Per-sheet cost is not directly visible, but regular roll equivalency is provided for fair comparison.\n- No 3-ply options shown, so only 1-ply and 2-ply differentiation is available.\n\nFor these reasons, Angel Soft Toilet Paper, 16 Mega Rolls, stands out as offering the best overall combination of value, quality, and customer satisfaction. I will proceed to add this item to the cart.",
