    "text": "Here\u2019s how I chose the best organic option from the page:\n\nPrimary decision criteria (in order)\n- Tracking performance and surface consistency: matters most for accurate cursor control in both work and gaming.\n- Size suitability for most desks: without your desk measurements, a standard-size pad is safer than full-desk mats or small wrist-rest styles.\n- Value for money: high performance at a low price.\n- Trust indicators: average rating and review volume.\n- Non-sponsored listing: excluded anything marked \u201cSponsored.\u201d\n\nHow each organic product stacks up\n- Aothia Leather Desk Pad Protector, $9.99, 4.6 (70,816): Full-desk PU leather is great for aesthetics and writing, but leather surfaces are usually less consistent than cloth for precise mouse tracking.\n- Amazon Basics Ergonomic Gel Mouse Pad with Wrist Rest, $9.71, 4.6 (33,033): Prioritizes wrist comfort over glide/precision and reduces usable mousing area; not ideal if you don\u2019t specifically want a wrist rest.\n- YSAGI Leather Desk Pad Protector, $9.99, 4.6 (13,319): Similar trade-offs to Aothia\u2014nice desk mat, not optimized for sensor tracking.\n- SteelSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pad \u2013 XXL, $24.99, 4.7 (100,313): Outstanding performance lineage, but the XXL full-desk size may not fit many setups and costs more.\n- Logitech G240 Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad, $7.99, 4.6 (2,774): Cloth surface with moderate friction optimized for gaming sensors, non-slip base, likely a standard size; excellent price-to-performance for general use.\n\nWhy the chosen product is superior\n- Best balance of precision cloth surface, everyday-friendly size, and lowest price among the organic options.\n- Strong brand reputation in gaming peripherals; rating is solid, even if review count is smaller than some desk mats.\n- Avoids the fit risk of XXL desk mats and the constraints of wrist-rest pads.\n\nAssumptions I made\n- You want a versatile, precise mouse pad for everyday work and occasional gaming rather than a full-desk mat or an ergonomic wrist-rest-specific pad.\n- Standard/medium size will fit your workspace better than XXL.\n\nLimitations from the screenshot\n- Exact dimensions and edge stitching aren\u2019t visible; I prioritized known surface type and general-use suitability. If you need a specific size or stitched edges, tell me and I can adjust.\n\nBased on the above, I\u2019m adding the Logitech G240 Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad, Optimized for Gaming Sensors, Moderate Surface Friction, Non-Slip Mouse Mat \u2013 Black to your cart.",
