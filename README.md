# Project Description

This is data preparation repository for ACES GUI simulator.
The GUI Simulator is a visual front-end for the Agentic Shopping Simulator. It provides an interactive, graphic illustration of how an AI “shopping agent” evaluates product listings and selects an item, using pre-run experimental outputs produced by ACES (Agentic e-Commerce Simulator). The pre-run experiment results are in the folder, according to the prompt mode user chooses. The interface is designed to make the underlying research results from the paper “What Is Your AI Agent Buying?” easy to explore and compare across models, prompts, and product-listing configuration
